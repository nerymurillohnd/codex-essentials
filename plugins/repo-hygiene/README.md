Repo Hygiene is a Codex plugin for people who need to understand Git repository
cleanup, integration, recovery, topology, or regression decisions before
allowing a change. It produces a plain-language audit report and numbered
recommendations; it does not perform cleanup, pruning, integration, history
rewrites, remote mutation, or bisection until the user approves specific
recommendation IDs.

The plugin version is recorded in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Install the
package from the repository's `main` catalog.

> [!CAUTION]
> An approval such as “clean it up” is not permission for destructive Git work.
> The user must approve the exact recommendation IDs after reviewing evidence,
> targets, risks, and recovery paths.

## Quick start

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add nerymurillohnd/codex-essentials --ref main
codex plugin add repo-hygiene@codex-essentials
codex plugin list
```

For everyday local cleanup candidates:

```text
Use $repo-hygiene:routine to audit this checkout and present cleanup recommendations for my approval.
```

For divergent branches, recovery, worktrees, refs, or object-store questions:

```text
Use $repo-hygiene:deep to audit Git topology and present recommendations for my approval.
```

For a reproducible regression, code search, or line-history investigation:

```text
Use $repo-hygiene:debug to investigate this reproducible regression and present findings for my approval.
```

## Use cases

| Scenario                                              | How the plugin helps                                                                     | Expected result                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A failed build left caches, logs, or ignored output.  | Audits one checkout, classifies candidates, and explains what is safe to consider.       | A bounded cleanup plan without file deletion.                    |
| A local branch may be stale or integrated.            | Proves local containment where possible and explains its limits.                         | A branch recommendation or a deep-audit escalation.              |
| Branches diverged or a recovery path is uncertain.    | Inspects revisions, topology, worktrees, reflogs, and objects under explicit invocation. | An evidence-led integration or preservation plan.                |
| A regression is reproducible between known revisions. | Searches tracked code, attributes lines, or isolates the first changed commit.           | A diagnostic finding and a separately approved remediation plan. |

**Not a fit when:** the user wants an unreviewed destructive cleanup, an
automatic force push, or a replacement for the repository's own access controls.

## Purpose

- Make repository state and risk understandable before any Git mutation.
- Separate routine checkout hygiene from topology, recovery, and forensic work.
- Keep the user in control of cleanup, pruning, integration, and recovery.

Current repository configuration, Git version, hosting provider policy, and
user authorization take precedence over this package's general guidance.

## Behavior and boundaries

## Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:** a repository path and a stated audit, cleanup, integration,
recovery, topology, or reproducible-regression objective. Optional inputs
include the intended base branch, known-good and known-bad revisions, test
command, allowed parent directories, provider context, and risk tolerance.

**Outputs:** a plain-language summary, audit scope and limitations, classified
findings, preserved or uncertain items, and a numbered recommendation plan. On
approval, outputs also include execution evidence, verification, and residual
risk.

## Required Tools and Credentials

Git is required. The plugin does not require credentials. Remote or provider
inspection may use only authentication already available and authorized for the
specific request; credential values are never reported.

## Permissions

| Access or effect | What the plugin may do                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read             | Inspect Git metadata, repository files, configuration provenance, and user-authorized provider state. |
| Write            | None during audit; only exact approved recommendation targets during execution.                       |
| Process          | Run Git inspection commands and project verification commands within the approved scope.              |
| Network          | None for routine work; read-only remote verification only with separate authorization.                |
| Authentication   | Reuse only existing, user-authorized credentials; never expose their values.                          |

## Side Effects

Installation changes Codex-managed plugin state only. Audits are read-only.
Approved execution can modify only the explicitly approved Git refs, files,
branches, worktrees, or remote targets and is revalidated immediately before
each action.

## Human Approval Boundaries

All skills audit first and present recommendation IDs. The user must approve
specific IDs, for example `Approve R1 and R3; retain R2`. Generic approval does
not authorize `git gc`, `git prune`, ref deletion, history rewrite, force push,
remote mutation, bisection, or deletion of uncertain recovery evidence.

## Installation Behavior

Installation adds `repo-hygiene:routine`, `repo-hygiene:deep`, and
`repo-hygiene:debug` to Codex. It does not modify the target project, initialize
Git, enable hooks, install dependencies, or configure credentials.

## Uninstall and Rollback Behavior

Refresh the marketplace when needed:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-essentials
codex plugin list
```

Remove only this plugin:

```bash
codex plugin remove repo-hygiene@codex-essentials
```

Uninstalling removes Codex-managed plugin state. It does not reverse any
previously approved Git operation; use the target repository's documented
recovery path, backups, tags, branches, reflogs, or provider history.

## Verification

Maintainers run:

```bash
./scripts/generate_marketplace.py
python3 scripts/test_generate_marketplace.py
```

Consumer smoke test: invoke either skill, confirm that it reports findings and
recommendations without mutation, approve one safe item explicitly, then review
the resulting verification report.

## Known Limitations

- A routine audit cannot prove remote or provider-side squash/rebase equivalence.
- Deep findings depend on accessible repositories, worktrees, reflogs, provider
  state, and user-authorized credentials.
- Debugging findings depend on a reproducible classification method and may be
  inconclusive when historical revisions cannot be tested.
- Git evidence can preserve recovery candidates but cannot prove an unobserved
  external clone or backup does not exist.

## Failure and Recovery

If a target, authority, provenance, or recovery value is uncertain, the plugin
preserves it and reports the limitation instead of proposing deletion. If a
precondition changes after approval, execution stops and returns an updated
recommendation plan. Use the target repository's Git recovery mechanisms rather
than bypassing hooks or protections.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does installing Repo Hygiene modify my repository?</summary>

No. Installation affects Codex-managed plugin state only. Repository changes
require an audit, a numbered recommendation, and approval of exact item IDs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can it delete files or branches automatically?</summary>

No. It can identify candidates and explain them, but it preserves uncertain
items and waits for specific approval before executing any recommendation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should I use the deep skill?</summary>

Use `$repo-hygiene:deep` for remotes, PR topology, divergent history,
integration decisions, worktrees, reflogs, hidden refs, object stores, or
recovery evidence.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should I use the debug skill?</summary>

Use `$repo-hygiene:debug` for a reproducible regression, a tracked-code search,
line attribution, or a known-good/known-bad history range. Starting a bisection
or automated test loop still requires approval of a recommendation ID.
