# 🛡️ Block No Verify

> Recommend and install a Codex Git bypass policy only after the user approves.

Block No Verify is a Codex skill plugin for a maintained Git verification and signing bypass policy. It does not install or enable a hook automatically.

Its bundled parser keeps shell-list, quoting, wrapper, and Git-option handling
in bounded helpers so strict Ruff complexity checks do not require suppressing
policy diagnostics.

## ⚡ Quick start

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add nerymurillohnd/codex-essentials --ref main
codex plugin add block-no-verify@codex-essentials
codex plugin list
```

Ask: `Use $block-no-verify to assess whether this repository should install the Git verification bypass policy.`

## 🎯 Use cases

| Scenario                                        | Result                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commit verification or signing bypasses matter. | A scoped policy recommendation, not an automatic configuration write. |
| A user approves project or user scope.          | Tested generated files and one merged handler pending user trust.     |

**Not a fit when:** server-side Git controls, branch protection, CI enforcement, or unrestricted shell evaluation are required.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Recommend a narrow policy for relevant commit, signing, bypass, or hook-policy work.
- Require explicit approval and project or user scope before target writes.
- Preserve existing hook sources and leave hook trust to the user.

## 🔐 Behavior and boundaries

## Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:** A Git-related request, selected scope, hook sources, and explicit approval.
**Outputs:** A recommendation, then approved generated files, a configuration merge, test result, and trust instructions.

## Required Tools and Credentials

No credential is required. A generated policy needs `python3`; its maintenance test needs Bash and `python3`.

## Permissions

| Access or effect | What this plugin may do                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read             | Inspect approved hook configuration, payload contracts, and generated files. |
| Write            | After approval, create selected files and one merged handler group.          |
| Process          | After approval, run the generated Bash maintenance test.                     |
| Network          | Not used.                                                                    |
| Authentication   | Not required.                                                                |

## Side Effects

Plugin installation changes only Codex-managed plugin state and skill discovery. A separately approved installation can add files and a `PreToolUse` handler to the selected configuration.

## Human Approval Boundaries

The skill never silently installs the policy. It requires explicit approval and project or user scope before a configuration write. The user must review and trust the non-managed definition in `/hooks`.

## Installation Behavior

Plugin installation exposes the skill and templates only. It does not create `.codex/`, alter a repository, modify `~/.codex`, execute templates, or register an active lifecycle hook.

## 🔁 Uninstall and Rollback Behavior

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-essentials
codex plugin remove block-no-verify@codex-essentials
```

Removal stops skill discovery but does not remove a policy generated elsewhere. Remove only its handler group and generated files from the selected scope, or restore them from Git history.

## ✅ Verification

```bash
./scripts/generate_marketplace.py
python3 scripts/test_generate_marketplace.py
uvx ruff@0.16.6 check --isolated plugins/block-no-verify/skills/block-no-verify/assets/templates/block-no-verify.py
uvx ruff@0.16.6 format --isolated --check plugins/block-no-verify/skills/block-no-verify/assets/templates/block-no-verify.py
```

The marketplace checks validate catalog generation and package discovery. The
Ruff commands validate the Python template. They do not prove Codex discovery,
trust, or live event execution.

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- The handler inspects literal Bash command text; it cannot resolve variables, aliases, `eval`, command substitutions, or opaque scripts.
- It covers supported Codex Bash tool calls, not remote Git policy, branch protection, server hooks, or CI controls.
- A passing template test does not make a target client trust or load a hook.

## Failure and Recovery

If the generated test fails, do not trust the changed policy. Restore known-good generated files and rerun after correcting the template or merge. If Codex does not list the hook, verify the selected source and inspect `/hooks`.
