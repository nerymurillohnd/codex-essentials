# 🧩 Codex Essentials

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE.md)

> A Git-backed marketplace of Codex plugins and skills for repeatable work.

**Explore:** [Plugins](#-plugin-catalog) · [Install](#-quick-start) ·
[Documentation](#-documentation-map) · [Contribute](#-contributing) ·
[Support](#-support-and-project-links)

Codex Essentials is for people who want to extend Codex with focused,
installable capabilities instead of rebuilding the same workflow each time.
The catalog covers stable use cases across software development, code quality,
documentation, maintenance, security, data analysis, and external-tool
integrations.

Each plugin is a self-contained package with its own skills, hooks, MCP servers,
apps, or other declared components. Its README explains what it does, what it
can access, which tools it needs, and what side effects or approvals apply.
Live Research can use specialized capabilities already callable in a user's
session without making those capabilities marketplace dependencies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a curated repository/CLI distribution source. It is not, by itself,
> evidence that these plugins are listed in the universal public Plugins
> Directory. Supported surfaces and availability can vary by Codex host.

> [!TIP]
> Start with a [use case](#-choose-by-use-case), inspect the linked plugin README,
> then install only the plugin that matches your need.

## ⚡ Quick start

Add the marketplace and install the plugin you need:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add nerymurillohnd/codex-essentials --ref main
codex plugin add <plugin-id>@codex-essentials
codex plugin list
```

`main` exposes the current catalog and is the supported installation reference.

Read the linked plugin README before installing a plugin with hooks, file
writes, network access, or other side effects.

## 🔁 Update or remove

Refresh a configured marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-essentials
```

Remove a plugin without removing the marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin remove <plugin-id>@codex-essentials
```

Remove the marketplace registration after its plugins are removed:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove codex-essentials
```

See the [official Codex plugin packaging guide](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins)
for current host, marketplace, manifest, and distribution behavior.

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`    | Generated catalog and plugin ordering.                                         |
| `plugins/<plugin-id>/`                | Self-contained distributable plugin packages.                                  |
| `plugins/*/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Authored plugin identity, version, and component declarations.                 |
| `docs/`                               | Maintainer architecture, contributor, operational, and decision documentation. |
| `schemas/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`      | Repository schemas, generators, validators, tests, and quality tooling.        |
| `.github/`                            | Repository contribution and issue configuration.                               |

The schemas, generators, validators, tests, and quality gates in this
repository are maintainer tooling used to create, review, and maintain the
marketplace. They are not packaged into installed plugins. The repository does
not install its own npm dependencies into a user's project; each plugin declares
its own behavior, requirements, permissions, and side effects in its product
README and authoritative skill documents.

## 🤝 Contributing

```bash
npm install
npm run check
```

For a plugin change, update its manifest, README, and changelog together, then
run the repository marketplace checks. The catalog is generated from validated
package manifests; do not hand-edit generated metadata.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the complete contributor contract and validation
details.

## 🏷️ Repository metadata

GitHub **topics** support repository discovery; the README links to plugins by
intent rather than duplicating a tag cloud. GitHub **issue labels** support
maintainer triage and are managed in Issues and contribution templates.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary>Is this the universal public Plugins Directory?</summary>

No. This is a curated repository/CLI marketplace. Availability in a particular
Codex or ChatGPT surface depends on that host's current support.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does installing a plugin install npm dependencies into my project?</summary>

No. The marketplace manages plugin packages in Codex. A plugin may still declare
its own project-level requirements or side effects; read its README first.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which plugin should I install?</summary>

Start with [Choose by use case](#-choose-by-use-case), then follow the plugin link
for requirements, permissions, and verification.
